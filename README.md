# VulnLab+ (Intentionally Vulnerable) — Interview / Training App


## Context
You will assess an intentionally vulnerable web application representing a modern stack (web APIs, file uploads, and AI-style integrations). Your objective is to identify, explain, and prioritize security vulnerabilities, and recommend practical fixes.

## Rules of Engagement
- Run the app only on localhost or a private sandbox.
- Do not deploy publicly or test systems outside the provided code.
- Avoid denial-of-service or destructive testing.
- Use only dummy data.
- Document critical issues; do not escalate exploitation

## Your Task
- Identify at least 5 security vulnerabilities.
- Explain risk, impact, and severity for each.
- Propose specific, realistic fixes.
- Prioritize findings based on real-world risk.
